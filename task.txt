REST API - JSON        

What should I do in this project

GET/users - get all users data as a html render
GET/API/Users - get the all users name
GET/API/Users/1 - get the user with Id 1
GET/Users/2 - get the user with Id 2

there is the id 1 or 2, it's not fixed. it should be dynamic. anyone can ask with any id

This term call dynamic path parameter
GET/users/:id

there :id means - variable(It's can store any kind of data and the server will query at this)

POST/API/Users - Create new user

PATCH/API/Users/1 - Edit the user 1

DELETE/API/Users/1 - Delete the user with Id 1
